# Blackjack Casino Game

## General Description
This project is a simplified C++ implementation of the casino card game Blackjack. The program allows a player to compete against a dealer using a standard 52-card deck. It displays both the player’s and dealer’s hands, calculates the player’s probability of winning, and simulates the effect of hitting a card. The overall goal is to create an interactive and realistic Blackjack experience.

## Programming Approaches
- Object-Oriented Design: The program uses classes and structures to represent key game components such as cards, the deck, and player and dealer hands. This design improves code organization, modularity, and maintainability.
- Simulation: Winning probabilities are estimated by simulating multiple rounds of Blackjack with a shuffled deck. This approach provides a statistical approximation of the player’s likelihood of winning under different conditions.
- Pseudorandom Shuffling: A pseudorandom shuffling algorithm is used to randomize the deck before gameplay, ensuring fair and unpredictable card distribution.
